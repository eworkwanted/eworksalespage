So I found Myself an EPS Sponsor who actually supplied My need for more specific guidance in this business.

Finally, I can honestly say I think this Eworkwanted&nbsp;EPS package is Your best and most affordable option to get started in this business quickly. &nbsp;Eworkwanted doesn't promote tiered $25, $50, $100+ price levels. (I believe that arbitrary pricing system is nonsense). Currently, at the time of launching Eworkwanted.com, The Eworkwanted EPS Package I offer has everything the $100+ level packages have. You won't have to buy in, several times like I did, just to find the right "fit". Passing this value onto You, My EPS recruited members, will allow You to enter this game with an advantage compared to the cost and value of packages found elsewhere. The whole idea is to give You a "leg up", so You can be proud in knowing You're offering everything You promise in terms of information and value, and knowing You're providing a great opportunity to the people You'll promote to. &nbsp;<br></p></div>

Posting to Craigslist may require patience and determination to get all of Your ads to "stick". That has to do with Craigslist ever changing algorhythms and is no fault of EPS at all, and <strong>it's more than possible to succeed as tons of people post to Craigslist everyday.</strong> There are methods You can use to minimize "flagging" and "ghosting" of Your ads &nbsp;on Craigslist. There's even a method I share with You, that is "flagging" and "ghosting proof" to get You started. There is also very detailed instructions, tips and tricks posted in Our facebook group.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Mind You, Craigslist is just ONE of MANY classified sites where You can post Your ads online.</strong>&nbsp;We focus on Craigslist mainly because of it's sheer size and popularity, but that's it. You're given a list of classified sites that will keep You busy and prosperous once You join. Not to mention, there's Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, Backpage, Tumblr, blogs, traffic exchanges, even some sales platforms where You can literally go bananas with Your ads. Some people even do offline promotions locally, wherever there's exposure. We make it work, and it does. Between the Eworkwanted EPS training and facebook group, <strong>We share everything We can to assist You in this business.</strong> Your success looks good for My business. You win, I win. That's how it works. Treat this like any other job or business You've worked at, and You'll be counted among the success stories, and quickly!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Now You know everything You'd ever need to make an informed decision, before jumping in head first.</strong></p><p>If this sounds like something You think You can manage, then join the Eworkwanted Team, and add another income stream to Your life today. <strong>Remember, the most important thing, no matter what You choose to do, is to just get started.&nbsp;</strong></p></div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  When did the Email Processing System (EPS) Launch?</strong></p><p>Launched in February of 2010, the Email Processing System (EPS) was an idea created by a husband and wife team whose whole goal was to create a simple copy and paste system to help others make money online from home.  Best described as an “income opportunity”, EPS is simply a direct sales membership site, where the one-time membership fee is paid directly to your sponsor.  Email Processing has become extremely popular and since it's launch, there have been dozens of ‘copy-cat' Email Processing sites that have surfaced.</p><p><a href="index.html" class="text-info">Get Started with Email Processing Systems</a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  What is “Email Processing”?</strong></p><p>Email Processing is perfect for newbies and those with little to no technical skills.  By simply copying the pre-written ads and posting them on the online classified ad sites; Craigslist and Backpage, (as well as any social media). you'll earn $25 for every email you process.  The process of “processing emails” happens when a new member signs up and pays the $25 to the person who posted the online classified ad that they are responding to.  When a payment is made, the sponsor will receive an email notification letting them know that they have just received a $25 payment.  The sponsors “job” is to actually process that email by copying and sending the pre-written getting started email to their new member which gives them access to the members area so that they can get started.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  What does the $25 Membership Fee Cover?  (What is the Product?)</strong></p><p>As a member of EPS, you will receive immediate access to the members area where you will find the pre-written ads which include hundreds of subject lines and dozens of ad bodies.  You will also receive UNLIMITED access to the EPS Support Team.  If you have questions or need help, the EPS Support Team is only an email away.  The support team consists of a group of seasoned Email Processors themselves who volunteer to help new members.  Simply send in an email with your question or request for help and one of the members of the EPS Support Team will respond within 48 hours (usually much sooner).  This is all included in the one-time $25 lifetime membership fee (may vary between $25-$50 depending on package, at Your sponsors discretion. I've seen EPS sponsors charge up to $250 to join, You will never pay that much to sign up with Me as Your sponsor, and You will earn $25 minimum per sign up as a full fledged EPS member regardless).</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  Where is the Company Located?</strong></p><p>The Email Processing System is not associated with a company.  Because EPS is offered as an online income opportunity with no admin fees being charged to members and all $25 payments being made directly from member to sponsor, our attorneys have deemed it unnecessary to establish company headquarters. </p><p>  </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  Is this a Scam or a Get Rich Quick Scheme?</strong></p><p>Absolutely Not!   A get rich quick scheme (or scam) usually promises to make a person extremely wealthy over a short period of time, often at the expense of little effort and at no risk.  After 6 years and with more than 100,000 members and counting, the Email Processing System absolutely works.  By simply placing online classified ads, we allow members to earn a 100% commission when others respond to those ads and decide to become members as well.  We have members who are earning hundreds (even thousands) everyday.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  Is this a Pyramid Scheme?</strong></p><p>No. This is a direct sales program that's been around since 2010.  You’ll make $25 every time you refer someone who purchases an EPS Membership.   As you go down the line of a company from top to bottom, the person or people that start it or those who join first makes the most money, and as more and more people join, the people at the top continue to make the most money while the newest people make pennies or sometimes nothing at all.  With the Email Processing System, all affiliates equally earn a full 100% commission.  A new person can easily earn hundreds daily and make more than someone whose been a member for years. Also, any business where money changes hands without the benefit of products or service is deemed a pyramid scheme by the FTC. Our members receive both a product (pre-written headlines and ads) and a service (unlimited access to the EPS Support Team) all for a one-time fee.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  Is this a Ponzi Scheme?</strong></p><p>No.   Ponzi Schemes are illegal and are associated with investment programs in which earlier investors are paid out from the funds of new</p><p>investors. Money is typically pooled together and promises of high-investment payouts are made. Typically the company collapses and the newest investors never receive a return of any kind. The Email Processing System is not an investment program of any kind.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  Is this a Matrix Program?</strong></p><p>No.   Matrix programs, also known as money doublers, cyclers, and randomizers have a commission system based on a specified percentage of the member’s deposit or from recruiting a specific amount of downline members before they ever earn a dime. Usually you won't receive a payout until a matrix is filled or a line cycles. The Email Processing System is not a matrix program of any kind. All members earn a 100% $25 commission on all sales.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  Is this a Multi-Level Marketing Program?</strong></p><p>No.  Multi-level marketing (MLM) is a marketing strategy in which the sales force is compensated not only for sales they personally generate, but also for the sales of the other salespeople that they recruit.  This recruited sales force is referred to as the participant's “downline”, and can provide multiple levels of compensation. MLM's usually charge an initial start-up cost to become a distributor which does not include any product. The Email Processing System is NOT a MLM program as there are absolutely no levels. The buyer makes just one payment directly to the referring member.  All members receive immediate access to the product including access to the EPS support team to help them learn how to advertise if they choose to promote the program.  There are no pass-up sales, no downlines, or monthly subscriptions of any kind being created.  There are also no admin fees, distributor fees or hidden fees of any kind.</p><p><a href="index.html" style="font-size: 1.07rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); line-height: 1.5;" class="text-info">Get Started with Email Processing Systems</a><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  Where can I get help if I need it?</strong></p><p>The Email Processing System provides it's members with access to the EPS Support Team via email so that you can get help.  If you have any questions or need help with ad posting, the EPS Support Team is available via email Monday – Friday.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  Why can't I call and talk to someone for help?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Email Processing System was designed to be extremely affordable for everyone.  Since we do not charge any admin fees or additional fees, we are unable to put a call center in place to offer support.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  How much money can I make with the Email Processing System?</strong></p><p>Similar to starting a weight-loss loss program or exercise regimen, your results completely depend on you and vary from person to person, but if you work hard and stay dedicated you can start to see great results.  The income potential is unlimited.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Q:  Is there a guarantee that I’ll make money?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Although we can not guarantee earnings, we CAN guarantee that you will earn $25 for every email you process.
