            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p><span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">The Email Processing Systems (EPS) launched in 2010 and is a copy and paste system designed to help people make money online.  In the past our refund policy was misused and exploited by members who created false reasons for refunds but continued to use the system.  Because of this we have now implemented a very strict NO REFUND policy.  Why?  Because these are digital products that are "unreturnable", and expose Our marketing methods. If You were to order a cheese burger and eat it, it's unethical to then ask for a refund. That would be a rip off. Once You get access to Our product and training, You now have Our complete blueprint at Your disposal at a unredeemable value. AMAZON has similar no-refund policies in place for certain software and digital downloads, so it's not unheard of, nor unreasonable. It's very much applicable in Our case also. Not to mention, Our &nbsp;system absolutely works.  How do we know?  Because you are here reading this page AND EPS now have over 114,000 members*.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>You see, your sponsor followed the system by placing ads, you responded to that ad and sent $25 -$50 directly to them.  They then “process your email” by giving you access to the members areas so that you can get started.  You are then a lifetime EPS member, and have been given access to all of our pre-written ad copy, our EPS made easy online course enrollment, Your free Web site template with easy instructions, as well as access to the EPS Support Team if you ever need help.  The EPS Support Team is available via email Monday – Friday from 10 AM to 7 PM EST.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You should also remember seeing this disclaimer on the site BEFORE you made the decision to join EPS:</strong> &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Email Processing Systems Disclaimer Below</p><p>***********************************DISCLAIMER ************************************</p><p>As a member, you get paid $25 for each email you process (minimum).  That's a 100% commission.  You are making a one-time $25 minimum payment to your sponsor for an EPS membership. There are NO admin fees, NO monthly fees.  In turn, the people who respond to your ads will pay you directly.  Because you will be given immediate access to the EPS members area and will have access to the step-by-step instructions and pre-written ads, we have a very strict NO REFUND POLICY.   By purchasing an EPS membership, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions. All fees are non- refundable. You agree there are no refunds for any reason and non-use does not constitute a reason for a refund  of any kind.  As part of our terms and conditions, you agree that you will NOT dispute / chargeback the order for ANY reason.  If you are not sure if you want to join EPS or if for any reason you are not comfortable due to this policy, we suggest that you wait until you are absolutely sure.</p><p><br></p><p>Every effort has been made to accurately represent this program and it's potential.  This is not a “get-rich- quick” opportunity, but it is a legitimate way to create an extra income from your home.  You'll be amazed at  how with some real effort you can see real results, but it's up to you to take the necessary action.  You will be given step-by-step instructions.  Any earnings or income statements &amp; income examples are only estimates of what we think you could earn.  There is no assurance you'll do as well.  We are a long-term business, our minimal effort system is designed to change your life for many years, use it correctly and it will.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Because you agreed to the above disclaimer, your sponsor is not allowed to issue a refund to you. You will always have access to the EPS members area and we can not take your access back.  You are not allowed to bully your sponsor into giving you a refund because you haven't made money, have changed your mind and decided that this is not for you, or for any other reason.  You have everything you need to make money with Email Processing.  Entering a dispute or initiating a Chargeback in an attempt to get a refund is strictly prohibited and is considered fraudulent.  To do so puts you in direct violation of the EPS no refund policy and could result in legal action against you!</p><p><br></p><p>If you have any questions about this policy, feel free to contact EPS Support directly at support@emailprocessingsystems.com</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>*IMPORTANT NOTE:  The current membership count is based on the number of members who have ordered sites to be created and hosted by YA YA Services, Inc. and continues to grow daily.  We have no accurate way of knowing the actual membership count because some EPS members choose to build &amp; host their own sites.  Since payments are sent directly from new member to their sponsor and we do not receive these payment notifications, we will never know how many members have joined the Email Processing System.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
